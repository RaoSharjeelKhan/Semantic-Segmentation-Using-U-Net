# Semantic-Segmentation-Using-U-Net
This project implements the U-Net architecture for semantic image segmentation. The goal is to predict a label for every pixel in an image by creating precise masks for each object in the image. 

## Experiment Description
In this project, we will build our own U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically designed for image segmentation tasks. We will apply semantic image segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class to create precise masks for objects. 

## Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

1. Colab Notebook containing the implementation of the U-Net model and the image segmentation experiment.

2. requirements.txt: Text file specifying the required Python dependencies for running the project.


## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-Segmentation-with-U-Net.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
